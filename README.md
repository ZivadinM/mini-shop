# Mini Shop Application

This project is a simple web-based mini shop where users can browse items, add them to the cart, specify quantities, and generate a bill in PDF format at checkout. The backend is built using **Spring Boot**, while the frontend leverages **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript** for a responsive user interface.

- **Add to Cart:** Users can add items to their cart and select the desired quantity.
- **Cart Management:** Users can view and modify the contents of their cart.
- **Checkout & PDF Invoice:** Upon checkout, the application generates a PDF invoice summarizing the order.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
